# CSC120FinalProject

Design Justification: 

Additional Reflection Questions:
- What was your overall approach to tackling this project?
  Our overall approach was writing out what we wanted to do, transferring our plan into steps written as TODO comments to ensure we complete each one, and distributing who completes each step equally. We then spent a long time testing and debugging our code together, using a combination of print statements, scouring code, and talking/writing through each step to see where the issue was.
