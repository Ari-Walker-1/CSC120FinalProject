# CSC120FinalProject

Design Justification: 

Additional Reflection Questions:
- What was your overall approach to tackling this project?

  Our overall approach was writing out what we wanted to do, transferring our plan into steps written as TODO comments to ensure we complete each one, and distributing who completes each step equally. We then spent a long time testing and debugging our code together, using a combination of print statements, scouring code, and talking/writing through each step to see where the issue was.
  
- What new thing(s) did you learn / figure out in completing this project?

  We used a multi-dimensional array for the board, which we had never worked with in class before. Something else we figured out was how to check if a spot was full. We thought at first that if a char value was equal to null or a space ' ', but soon realized our code did not work using either of these values. We decided a more efficient method would simply be checking if a char was equal to 'X' or 'O', and if not, then it was an empty spot on the board.
