# CSC120FinalProject

Design Justification: 

Additional Reflection Questions:
- What was your overall approach to tackling this project?

  Our overall approach was writing out what we wanted to do, transferring our plan into steps written as TODO comments to ensure we complete each one, and distributing who completes each step equally. We then spent a long time testing and debugging our code together, using a combination of print statements, scouring code, and talking/writing through each step to see where the issue was.
  
- What new thing(s) did you learn / figure out in completing this project?

  We used a multi-dimensional array for the board, which we had never worked with in class before. Something else we figured out was how to check if a spot was full. We thought at first that if a char value was equal to null or a space ' ', but soon realized our code did not work using either of these values. We decided a more efficient method would simply be checking if a char was equal to 'X' or 'O', and if not, then it was an empty spot on the board.
  
- Is there anything that you wish you had implemented differently?

  By the end of our project, main looked very cluttered. If we could've found a way to create more functions that would make our code in main smoother and even less repetetive, that would've been great.
  
- If you had unlimited time, what additional features would you implement?

  If we had time, we could have implemented graphics instead of printing the board in the terminal.
  
- What was the most helpful piece of feedback you received while working on your project? Who gave it to you?

  Mackenzie Martin gave a useful piece of advice to add many more print statements to help debug.
  
- If you could go back in time and give your past self some advice about this project, what hints would you give?

  I would say to look much more carefully at what character we were checking a value was equal to. Since chars are so short, it's easy to gloss over small mistakes that may be causing big problems in the code.
  
- If you worked with a team: please comment on how your team dynamics influenced your experience working on this project.

  Our team dynamic worked well. I was glad to have another set of eyes while debugging, since it would've taken me forever to spot certain things. We were also both able to find times to meet up to work on the project and put equal amounts of work into it, which was very nice.
